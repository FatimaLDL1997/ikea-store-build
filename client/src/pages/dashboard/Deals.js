          I guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase "meant to be."
          That is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly
          referential semantics and other mumbo-jumbo. Maybe such a discussion
          would result in the determination that "meant to be" is exactly as
          meaningless a phrase as it seems to be, and that none of us is
          actually meant to be doing anything at all. But that's my existential
          underpants underpinnings showing. It's the way the cookie crumbles.
          And now I want a cookie.
